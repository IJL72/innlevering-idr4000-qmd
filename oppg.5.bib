	abstract = {Based on the findings of previous research, in the present study, we aimed to establish a progressive training model for older adults as well as young and middle-aged adults, including subjects undergoing rehabilitation and trained subjects, for maintaining or increasing muscle mass and strength by discussing the potential interaction among the following three factors: exercise load, muscular fatigue, and speed of movement. All these factors usually enhance muscle growth by maximizing muscle fiber recruitment and fast-twitch fiber utilization. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation and endurance exercise, such as walking and cycling, can induce muscle hypertrophy and strength gain to different extents for certain muscles (working muscles) and/or age groups. Moreover, the development of muscular fatigue via blood flow restriction in working muscles can enhance the hypertrophic effect. Ensuring greater speed while walking also appears to yield greater strength gain in older adults. However, the addition of resistance exercise to the exercise program of individuals who regularly perform endurance exercise may be effective for maintaining or increasing muscle mass and strength. As the effects of body mass-based resistance training (RT) depend on the relative value of muscle strength to body mass and the muscle size before intervention, RT with external weights would need to be employed for trained subjects. Recent research has demonstrated that low external weight training can induce hypertrophy that is comparable to that induced by high external weight training when each set is performed until lifting failure. Nevertheless, favorable strength gain is achieved when high external load is used. Furthermore, previous studies indicated that higher lifting speed during RT can result in greater strength gain in young adults, although this finding is not always observed in older adults. Hence, it is important to understand the characteristics of each training method to assign the most suitable training program based on the individual's fitness level and goals. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of 24 weeks of resistance training (RT) performed 2 vs. 3 times per week on muscle strength, muscle mass, and muscle quality in older women. Thirty-nine older women (≥ 60 years old) were randomly assigned to two groups according to RT frequency (G2x = two sessions per week, n=19; and G3x = three sessions per week, n=20) and were submitted to 24 weeks of whole-body RT, divided into two stages of 12 weeks. In the first stage, participants performed 1 set of 10 to 15 repetitions in each of eight exercise, whereas in the second stage, they performed 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. Muscle strength was assessed by one repetition maximum (1RM) tests in chest press, knee extension, and biceps preacher curl, while the lean soft tissue was estimated by DXA. The muscle quality index was determined by the ratio between strength and lean soft tissue. There were observed similar increases between groups for muscle strength (G2x=19.5\%; G3x=22.2\%), lean soft tissue (G2x=3.0\%; G3x=1.6\%), and muscle quality index (G2x=16.0\%; G3x=21.1\%). These results indicate that RTinduced muscular adaptation occurs regardless of training twice or thrice a week in older women. Instructors, coaches and practitioners can choose their training frequency preference, since both frequencies provided similar adaptations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

	abstract = {Increases in muscle size and strength are influenced by the mechanical and metabolic stresses imposed by resistance training. Mechanical stress is induced by the use of high-intensity training and it is believed it activates a larger percentage of muscle fibers. Conversely, metabolic stress is generated by high training volumes with moderate intensities using short rest intervals. This training paradigm results in greater fatigue and potentially stimulates a greater anabolic hormone response to exercise. Although evidence exists for both strategies, it still remains inconclusive whether one training paradigm is more advantageous than the other regarding muscle hypertrophy development. In untrained adults, the novelty of most resistance training programs may be sufficient to promote hypertrophy and strength gains, whereas greater training intensity may be more beneficial for trained adults. However, the body of well-designed research in this advanced population is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this brief review is to discuss the merits and limitations of the current evidence.

	abstract = {This systematic review and meta-analysis determined resistance training (RT) load effects on various muscle hypertrophy, strength, and neuromuscular performance task [e.g., countermovement jump (CMJ)] outcomes. Relevent studies comparing higher-load [{\textgreater}60\% 1-repetition maximum (RM) or {\textless}15-RM] and lower-load (≤60\% 1-RM or ≥ 15-RM) RT were identified, with 45 studies (from 4713 total) included in the meta-analysis. Higher- and lower-load RT induced similar muscle hypertrophy at the whole-body (lean/fat-free mass; [ES (95\% CI) = 0.05 (−0.20 to 0.29), P = 0.70]), whole-muscle [ES = 0.06 (−0.11 to 0.24), P = 0.47], and muscle fibre [ES = 0.29 (−0.09 to 0.66), P = 0.13] levels. Higher-load RT further improved 1-RM [ES = 0.34 (0.15 to 0.52), P = 0.0003] and isometric [ES = 0.41 (0.07 to 0.76), P = 0.02] strength. The superiority of higher-load RT on 1-RM strength was greater in younger [ES = 0.34 (0.12 to 0.55), P = 0.002] versus older [ES = 0.20 (−0.00 to 0.41), P = 0.05] participants. Higher- and lower-load RT therefore induce similar muscle hypertrophy (at multiple physiological levels), while higher-load RT elicits superior 1-RM and isometric strength. The influence of RT loads on neuromuscular task performance is however unclear. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Resistance training (RT) is a widely practised type of training, and the number of adherents of this type of physical exercise is increasing each year. Among the most sought objectives of those who initiate RT is muscle hypertrophy, although success in this process depends on a well-designed protocol and good manipulation of training variables. The present study aims to analyse, through a systematic review, the impact of the RT variables (such as intensity, volume, recovery interval, execution speed, and concentric muscle failure) relevant to muscle hypertrophy and if there is an ideal range for each training variable. The research was carried out in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Scielo databases from 2000 to 2020, using the terms "resistance training" and "hypertrophy" and "intensity" or "volume" or "recovery interval" or "execution speed" or "muscular failure". Twenty-three articles were included in the review. The PEDro scale was used to analyse the quality of the selected articles. It was concluded that the variables intensity and volume must be carefully analysed in a training program. Despite not having a direct impact on hypertrophy, the other variables affect the intensity and volume and must be manipulated according to what is intended with the others. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
