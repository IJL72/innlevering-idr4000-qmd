	abstract = {Based on the findings of previous research, in the present study, we aimed to establish a progressive training model for older adults as well as young and middle-aged adults, including subjects undergoing rehabilitation and trained subjects, for maintaining or increasing muscle mass and strength by discussing the potential interaction among the following three factors: exercise load, muscular fatigue, and speed of movement. All these factors usually enhance muscle growth by maximizing muscle fiber recruitment and fast-twitch fiber utilization. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation and endurance exercise, such as walking and cycling, can induce muscle hypertrophy and strength gain to different extents for certain muscles (working muscles) and/or age groups. Moreover, the development of muscular fatigue via blood flow restriction in working muscles can enhance the hypertrophic effect. Ensuring greater speed while walking also appears to yield greater strength gain in older adults. However, the addition of resistance exercise to the exercise program of individuals who regularly perform endurance exercise may be effective for maintaining or increasing muscle mass and strength. As the effects of body mass-based resistance training (RT) depend on the relative value of muscle strength to body mass and the muscle size before intervention, RT with external weights would need to be employed for trained subjects. Recent research has demonstrated that low external weight training can induce hypertrophy that is comparable to that induced by high external weight training when each set is performed until lifting failure. Nevertheless, favorable strength gain is achieved when high external load is used. Furthermore, previous studies indicated that higher lifting speed during RT can result in greater strength gain in young adults, although this finding is not always observed in older adults. Hence, it is important to understand the characteristics of each training method to assign the most suitable training program based on the individual's fitness level and goals. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of 24 weeks of resistance training (RT) performed 2 vs. 3 times per week on muscle strength, muscle mass, and muscle quality in older women. Thirty-nine older women (≥ 60 years old) were randomly assigned to two groups according to RT frequency (G2x = two sessions per week, n=19; and G3x = three sessions per week, n=20) and were submitted to 24 weeks of whole-body RT, divided into two stages of 12 weeks. In the first stage, participants performed 1 set of 10 to 15 repetitions in each of eight exercise, whereas in the second stage, they performed 2 sets of 10 to 15 repetitions. Muscle strength was assessed by one repetition maximum (1RM) tests in chest press, knee extension, and biceps preacher curl, while the lean soft tissue was estimated by DXA. The muscle quality index was determined by the ratio between strength and lean soft tissue. There were observed similar increases between groups for muscle strength (G2x=19.5\%; G3x=22.2\%), lean soft tissue (G2x=3.0\%; G3x=1.6\%), and muscle quality index (G2x=16.0\%; G3x=21.1\%). These results indicate that RTinduced muscular adaptation occurs regardless of training twice or thrice a week in older women. Instructors, coaches and practitioners can choose their training frequency preference, since both frequencies provided similar adaptations. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

	abstract = {Increases in muscle size and strength are influenced by the mechanical and metabolic stresses imposed by resistance training. Mechanical stress is induced by the use of high-intensity training and it is believed it activates a larger percentage of muscle fibers. Conversely, metabolic stress is generated by high training volumes with moderate intensities using short rest intervals. This training paradigm results in greater fatigue and potentially stimulates a greater anabolic hormone response to exercise. Although evidence exists for both strategies, it still remains inconclusive whether one training paradigm is more advantageous than the other regarding muscle hypertrophy development. In untrained adults, the novelty of most resistance training programs may be sufficient to promote hypertrophy and strength gains, whereas greater training intensity may be more beneficial for trained adults. However, the body of well-designed research in this advanced population is limited. Therefore, the purpose of this brief review is to discuss the merits and limitations of the current evidence.

	abstract = {This systematic review and meta-analysis determined resistance training (RT) load effects on various muscle hypertrophy, strength, and neuromuscular performance task [e.g., countermovement jump (CMJ)] outcomes. Relevent studies comparing higher-load [{\textgreater}60\% 1-repetition maximum (RM) or {\textless}15-RM] and lower-load (≤60\% 1-RM or ≥ 15-RM) RT were identified, with 45 studies (from 4713 total) included in the meta-analysis. Higher- and lower-load RT induced similar muscle hypertrophy at the whole-body (lean/fat-free mass; [ES (95\% CI) = 0.05 (−0.20 to 0.29), P = 0.70]), whole-muscle [ES = 0.06 (−0.11 to 0.24), P = 0.47], and muscle fibre [ES = 0.29 (−0.09 to 0.66), P = 0.13] levels. Higher-load RT further improved 1-RM [ES = 0.34 (0.15 to 0.52), P = 0.0003] and isometric [ES = 0.41 (0.07 to 0.76), P = 0.02] strength. The superiority of higher-load RT on 1-RM strength was greater in younger [ES = 0.34 (0.12 to 0.55), P = 0.002] versus older [ES = 0.20 (−0.00 to 0.41), P = 0.05] participants. Higher- and lower-load RT therefore induce similar muscle hypertrophy (at multiple physiological levels), while higher-load RT elicits superior 1-RM and isometric strength. The influence of RT loads on neuromuscular task performance is however unclear. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Resistance training (RT) is a widely practised type of training, and the number of adherents of this type of physical exercise is increasing each year. Among the most sought objectives of those who initiate RT is muscle hypertrophy, although success in this process depends on a well-designed protocol and good manipulation of training variables. The present study aims to analyse, through a systematic review, the impact of the RT variables (such as intensity, volume, recovery interval, execution speed, and concentric muscle failure) relevant to muscle hypertrophy and if there is an ideal range for each training variable. The research was carried out in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and Scielo databases from 2000 to 2020, using the terms "resistance training" and "hypertrophy" and "intensity" or "volume" or "recovery interval" or "execution speed" or "muscular failure". Twenty-three articles were included in the review. The PEDro scale was used to analyse the quality of the selected articles. It was concluded that the variables intensity and volume must be carefully analysed in a training program. Despite not having a direct impact on hypertrophy, the other variables affect the intensity and volume and must be manipulated according to what is intended with the others. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {The applications of Western/immunoblotting ( WB) techniques have reached multiple layers of the scientific community and are now considered routine procedures in the field of physiology. This is none more so than in relation to skeletal muscle physiology (i.e., resolving the mechanisms underpinning adaptations to exercise). Indeed, the inclusion of WB data is now considered an essential aspect of many such physiological publications to provide mechanistic insight into regulatory processes. Despite this popularity, and due to the ubiquitous and relatively inexpensive availability of WB equipment, the quality of WB in publications and subsequent analysis and interpretation of the data can be variable, perhaps resulting in spurious conclusions. This may be due to poor laboratory technique and/or lack of comprehension of the critical steps involved in WB and what quality control procedures should be in place to ensure robust data generation. The present review aims to provide a detailed description and critique of WB procedures and technicalities, from sample collection through preparation, blotting and detection, to analysis of the data collected. We aim to provide the reader with improved expertise to critically conduct, evaluate, and troubleshoot the WB process, to produce reproducible and reliable blots. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

	abstract = {Gene expression analysis by quantitative PCR in skeletal muscle is routine in exercise studies. The reproducibility and reliability of the data fundamentally depend on how the experiments are performed and interpreted. Despite the popularity of the assay, there is a considerable variation in experimental protocols and data analyses from different laboratories, and there is a lack of consistency of proper quality control steps throughout the assay. In this study, we present a number of experiments on various steps of quantitative PCR workflow, and demonstrate how to perform a quantitative PCR experiment with human skeletal muscle samples in an exercise study. We also tested some common mistakes in performing qPCR. Interestingly, we found that mishandling of muscle for a short time span (10 mins) before RNA extraction did not affect RNA quality, and isolated total RNA was preserved for up to one week at room temperature. Demonstrated by our data, use of unstable reference genes lead to substantial differences in the final results. Alternatively, cDNA content can be used for data normalisation; however, complete removal of RNA from cDNA samples is essential for obtaining accurate cDNA content.},

	abstract = {Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test, assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of single measurements and better tracking of changes in measurements in research or practical settings. The main measures of reliability are within-subject random variation, systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple, adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an individual’s repeated measurements. For many measurements in sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an individual’s measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the sample of participants. Uses of reliability include decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error as the standard measure of reliability would improve the assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.},

	abstract = {Internal validity refers to the degree of control exerted over potential confounding variables to reduce alternative explanations for the effects of various treatments. In exercise and sports-science research and routine testing, internal validity is commonly achieved by controlling variables such as exercise and warm-up protocols, prior training, nutritional intake before testing, ambient temperature, time of testing, hours of sleep, age, and gender. However, a number of other potential confounding variables often do not receive adequate attention in sports physiology and performance research. These confounding variables include instructions on how to perform the test, volume and frequency of verbal encouragement, knowledge of exercise endpoint, number and gender of observers in the room, influence of music played before and during testing, and the effects of mental fatigue on performance. In this review the authors discuss these variables in relation to common testing environments in exercise and sports science and present some recommendations with the goal of reducing possible threats to internal validity.

	abstract = {There is increasing evidence for strong genetic influences on athletic performance and for an evolutionary “trade-off” between performance traits for speed and endurance activities. We have recently demonstrated that the skeletal-muscle actin-binding protein α-actinin-3 is absent in 18\% of healthy white individuals because of homozygosity for a common stop-codon polymorphism in the ACTN3 gene, R577X. α-Actinin-3 is specifically expressed in fast-twitch myofibers responsible for generating force at high velocity. The absence of a disease phenotype secondary to α-actinin-3 deficiency is likely due to compensation by the homologous protein, α-actinin-2. However, the high degree of evolutionary conservation of ACTN3 suggests function(s) independent of ACTN2. Here, we demonstrate highly significant associations between ACTN3 genotype and athletic performance. Both male and female elite sprint athletes have significantly higher frequencies of the 577R allele than do controls. This suggests that the presence of α-actinin-3 has a beneficial effect on the function of skeletal muscle in generating forceful contractions at high velocity, and provides an evolutionary advantage because of increased sprint performance. There is also a genotype effect in female sprint and endurance athletes, with higher than expected numbers of 577RX heterozygotes among sprint athletes and lower than expected numbers among endurance athletes. The lack of a similar effect in males suggests that the ACTN3 genotype affects athletic performance differently in males and females. The differential effects in sprint and endurance athletes suggests that the R577X polymorphism may have been maintained in the human population by balancing natural selection.},

In this case:control genetic study we determined the association between elite athletic status and the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism within three cohorts of European Caucasian men, i.e. Spanish, Polish and Russian [633 cases (278 elite endurance and 355 power athletes), and 808 non-athletic controls]. The odds ratio (OR) of a power athlete harbouring the XX versus the RR genotype compared with sedentary controls was 0.54 [95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.34–0.48; P = 0.006]. We also observed that the OR of an endurance athlete having the XX versus the RR genotype compared with power athletes was 1.88 (95\%CI: 1.07–3.31; P = 0.028). In endurance athletes, the OR of a “world-class” competitor having the XX genotype versus the RR+RX genotype was 3.74 (95\%CI: 1.08–12.94; P = 0.038) compared with those of a lower (“national”) competition level. No association (P{\textgreater}0.1) was noted between the ACTN3 R577X polymorphism and competition level (world-class versus national-level) in power athletes.

	abstract = {The alpha-actinin-3 r577x polymorphism (rs1815739) is one of the most important polymorphisms associated with athletic performance. This single-nucleotide mutation leads to a premature stop codon, resulting in a nonfunctional protein product. The presence of the dominant R allele is associated with full power skeletal muscle contraction. Homozygosity for the X allele is correlated with more efficient energy disposure. Restriction fragment length polymorphism and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are the standard methods used to genotype this polymorphism, but they are expensive and require special equipments. Here, we present a simple and cost-efficient method to genotype the ACTN3 r577x polymorphism by a single PCR. External primers yield a 690-bp product that indicates the template quality. Internal primers produce a 413-bp product if the R allele is present and a 318-bp product if the X allele is present. Our four-primer genotyping PCR was validated by the standard real-time PCR, generally used to genotype this single-nucleotide polymorphism, demonstrating the accuracy of this method. This protocol is perfect for small- or large-scale cohort genotyping of the ACTN3 r577x polymorphism.},
